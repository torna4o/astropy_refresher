# astropy_refresher
Refreshing important astropy commands and methods with examples.

Of course, I would advise everyone to go first to the original website of the Astropy: https://learn.astropy.org/tutorials/
In my case, to remember what I learnt, this kind of approach is more useful, where you actually combine related codes in a single file and can immediately run through all.

All the best!
